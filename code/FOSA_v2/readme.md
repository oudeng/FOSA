# What's it?
Improved from FOSA v1 as an utility.
- Deal with any csv dataset with missing data.
- In the working python file with clear inputs and ```import FOSA as FOSA```.
- Visulize FOSA imputation results of each variate(= the col of dataset).

# How to use it?
Very easy.
1. Download FOSA.py, FOSA_test.py to your local PC.
2. Put your CSV dataset(with missing data) in the same fold or any specific location.
   or you can download Test_datasets as sample data.
4. Change the dataset location and other inputs in FOSA_test.py, which is an easy understood sample.
5. In your terminal: $ python FOSA_test.py

# Python environment
- PyTorch: the structure for Self-Attention
- sklearn: for data proceeding
- semopy: for FIML estimation
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib: our honest old friends always.
